# Project Overview
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains the design and simulation of a low-power approximate full adder using Cadence Virtuoso with 180nm CMOS technology. The project is based on the journal paper:

## LAHAF: Low-power, area-efficient, and high-performance approximate full adder based on static CMOS

The work focuses on reducing power consumption while maintaining acceptable performance, making it suitable for error-resilient applications such as image processing, machine learning, and data mining. Due to the human visual systemâ€™s tolerance to small inaccuracies, approximate computing is highly effective in applications involving image and video processing.

## In this project:

* The TGA 1 circuit (as proposed in the journal) was implemented at the schematic level in Cadence Virtuoso.

* Functional simulation was performed to verify the behavior of the full adder.

* Average power consumption was estimated using pre-layout transient analysis.

* This design demonstrates how approximate adders can achieve low power dissipation, area efficiency, and high performance, making them ideal for power-constrained systems.
